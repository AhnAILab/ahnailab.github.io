The `_layouts/courses` layout can be used to showcase courses that were taught in the past or are currently being taught. Courses are defined in the `_data/settings.yml` file, and markdown pages for each course with the `_layouts/page.html` layout can be placed in the `courses` directory. Related course material, such as PDF files, can also be placed in the `courses` directory in a subdirectory with the same name as the corresponding course.
