The `_layouts/publications` layout can be used to showcase selected publications, or the entire catalogue of publications. Direct links to the paper can be used, or a PDF copy of the paper can be served. Publications are defined in the `_data/publications.yml` file, and any PDF files that are served can be placed in the `publications` directory.
